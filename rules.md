3. **MATCH RELATED RULES**
    **QUALIFICATION OF PLAYERS**


        (A) (i)	A Player is one who, being in all other respects eligible, has:-

1. _signed a fully and correctly completed Competition registration form  in ink, countersigned by his /her parent or guardian and by an Officer     of the Club, and who has been registered with the (Registrations) Secretary 3 days prior to the Player playing and whose completed registration counterfoil has been received by the Club prior to playing in a Competition Match. The registration document must incorporate emergency contact details of the Player’s parents or guardians. These details must be available at matches and training events the Player attends within the management of the Club or Competition;_

            _or_

2. _signed a fully and correctly completed Competition registration form  in ink on a match day prior to playing which is countersigned by his/   her parent or guardian and by an Officer of the Club and witnessed by  an Officer of the opposing Club, and submitted to the (Registrations) Secretary within two days (Sundays excluded) subsequent to the Competition Match. The Player shall not play again on a subsequent match day until the Club is in possession of the completed counterfoil. A maximum of double the team format of Players may be registered in accordance with this paragraph 18 (A) (i) (b). The registration document must incorporate emergency contact details of the Players’ parents or guardians. These details must be available at matches and training events the Player attends within the management of the Club or Competition;_

            _or_

3. _registered through WGS._

        Any registration form which is sent by either of the means set out at Rules 18(A) (i)(a) or (b) above that is not fully and correctly completed will be returned to the Club unprocessed. If a Club attempts to register a player via WGS but does not fully and correctly complete the necessary information via WGS, the registration will not be processed.


        For Clubs registering Players under Rules 18 (A) (i) (a) or (b) registration forms will be provided in a format to be determined by the Competition. For Clubs registering Players via WGS (under Rule 18 (A) (i) (c)) Clubs must access WGS in order to complete the registration process.

1. Registration forms may also be submitted to the (Registrations) Secretary by electronic mail or facsimile machine prior to the Player playing in a Competition Match. The original document must be forwarded by post to the appropriate Officer of the Competition within three days of the Competition Match. 

        _The registration document must incorporate a current passport-size photograph of the Player seeking registration together with confirmation that the Player’s proof of date of birth has been checked by the Club and is accurate._


    Failure to comply with this Rule will result in a fine in accordance with the Fines Tariff.

1. (i)	Contract Players are not permitted in this Competition with the exception of those Players who are registered under contract with the same Club who have a Team operating at Steps 1 to 6 of the National League System.

        It is the responsibility of each Club to ensure that any Player registered to the Club has, where necessary, the required International Transfer Certificate. Clearance is required for any Player aged 10 and over crossing borders including Wales, Scotland and Ireland.

    1. A Player registered with a Premier League or English Football League Academy under the Elite Player Performance Plan contained within Youth Development Rules will not be permitted to play in this Competition. Details of the Youth Development Rules are published on The FA website. A Player registered with a FA Girls’ Regional Talent Club may play in this Competition subject to the FA Programme for Excellence (Female) Regulations.

        Additionally, where Club run both academy Teams and inclusive Teams the latter would be allowed entry.  In the Management Committee's view where a 'Club' has affiliated with SCFA both as an academy and also as a non-academy, no Players that have registered for the academy Team can register for the non-academy Team. \



        In most cases the Rother Youth League will accept the goodwill and trust of Clubs in the grey areas around what constitutes an academy and allow entry on the condition that this trust is repaid, and we have a fair playing field. Abuse of this trust will result in a Special General Meeting where the Management Committee will propose to expel the offending Club and not just the Team.


         \
The following are example of illegible Players that would fall foul of the academy Team ruling where a Club run an academy:


        a) A Player who registers to an academy and plays for an academy and non-academy Teams at the same Club


        b) A Player who plays in an academy game


        c) If the Player or their parent/guardian has been told they have registered on to the academy.


         \
As per Competition Rules, if a Player falls within the above Clauses a, b, c and d and plays in a Rother Youth Football League Competition Match he/she will be classed as an ineligible Player and will be dealt with in accordance with Competition Rules, also if it is found that the Player has played in previous games the same rules will apply. \


    2. Each Team must have the following number of Players registered 7 days before the start of each Playing Season and may not have more than the maximum permitted number of players:

        Failure to comply with this Rule will result in a fine in accordance with the Fines Tariff.

2. A child who has not attained the age of 6 shall not play, and shall not be permitted or encouraged to play, in a match of any kind.

    The relevant age for each Player is determined by his or her age as at midnight on 31 August of the relevant Playing Season i.e. children who are aged 6 as at midnight on 31 August in a Playing Season (together with those who attain the age of 6 during the Playing Season) will be classed as Under 7 Players for that Playing Season. Children who are aged 7 as at midnight on 31 August in a Playing Season will be classed as Under 8 Players for that Playing Season, and so on.


    Notwithstanding the above, a child is permitted to play up in the age group above his or her chronological age group, irrespective of any changes of format or competition structure, save that a child who attains the age of 6 after 31 August is permitted to play only in the Under 7 age group, and may not play in the Under 8 age group, for that Playing Season.


    The age groups that children are eligible to play in are set out in the table below, along with the permitted football formats for each of those age groups. Children shall not play, and shall not be permitted or encouraged to play, in a match between sides of more than the stated number of players, according to their age group:

Each Club shall be responsible for ensuring that its Players, officials and spectators conduct themselves in an orderly fashion and refrain from violent, threatening, abusive, obscene or provocative behaviour, conduct or language, whilst attending or taking part in a match, whether on its own ground or elsewhere.

Any Club that fails to effectively discharge its said responsibility in any respect whatsoever may be guilty of misconduct and is liable to be dealt with by the appropriate County Football Association.

The Competition shall require all Players and Club officials to have signed the relevant FA Respect Code of Conduct or similar, and these must be produced to the Management Committee if so requested.

The participating Teams and officials shall conduct the ‘Respect’ handshake prior to the match, and/or shall offer ‘three cheers’ and handshakes to the opposing Team after the match.

Each Club shall make arrangements for the provision of designated areas for spectators at its home Ground(s).  This area can be marked by an additional white painted line, the use of cones, a roped-off area, or the use of a temporary spectator barrier.  The area for spectators should start two (2) metres from the touchline on both sides of the pitch.  Each area should run the full length of the pitch.  Spectators and Club officials shall not be allowed to stand behind either goal line.  

It is recognised, however, that the alignment of some public pitches does not allow for this arrangement, in which case other appropriate arrangements for allocating spectator areas should be made by the home Team.

Following completion of a fixture, each Team shall award the opposing Team a sportsmanship mark, to reflect their view of how the opposition Players, officials and spectators conducted themselves before, during and after the game.  This sportsmanship mark shall be provided to the Competition in the prescribed manner (e.g.- via the online match return form).

Any Team awarding a sportsmanship mark to its opposition of fifty (50) or below must provide in writing, to the Competition’s Registrations Secretary, an explanation of the reason for the marking within seven (7) days of the date that the fixture was played.   

Clubs failing to comply with the sportsmanship obligations set-out in this Rule shall incur a fine as set-out in the Fines Tariff, increasing in multiples of the same for each subsequent offence.

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>**25.  FIRST AID**

At all Competition matches, each Team is expected to provide someone who has attended an FA Emergency Aid course, or similar, within the last three (3) years.  Copies of the relevant Certificate should be provided to the League’s Child Welfare Officer, if so requested.

In addition, each Team must ensure that they have an up-to-date First Aid Kit with them at all Competition fixtures. Clubs failing to comply with this part of the Rule shall incur a fine as set-out in the Fines Tariff, increasing in multiples of the same for each subsequent offence.

   <td>**26.  LEAGUE CUP RULES**

The League Cup competitions, when operated, shall be called : (i) Under 10 Challenge Cup, (ii) Under 11 BeSure Security Systems Cup, (iii) Under 12 Wayne Russell Cup, (iv) Under 13 Top Flight Trophy, (v) Under 14 BeSure Security Systems Cup, (vi) Under 15 Challenge Cup, (vii) Under 16 Laurie Webber Cup, and (viii) Under 17 Challenge Cup.

Entry to these Cup competitions shall be open to all eligible Teams participating in the Competition.

The draw for these Cup competitions shall be made at the beginning of every Playing Season, in the presence of at least two (2) members of the Management Committee and two (2) representatives of member Clubs.

Teams drawn first shall be regarded as the home side.

The finals shall be played, wherever possible, on a neutral ground with a neutral Referee and Assistant Referees which shall be provided by the Competition.

Competition-appointed Referee and Assistant Referee fees shall be as per normal Competition Rules.

The duration of Cup games shall be as per normal Competition Rules.

In the event of the scores being level at the end of normal time, extra time shall be played.  If the tie is still undecided at the end of extra time, the tie shall be settled by the taking of penalty kicks, in accordance with the Laws of the Game.

When required, the duration of extra time shall be:

	U10 & U11 – Five (5) minutes each way;

	U12-U16 – Ten (10) minutes each way;

	U17 – Fifteen (15) minutes each way.

Qualification and eligibility of players in Cup fixtures shall be the same as for Competition fixtures.

Fines for fielding an ineligible player shall be as set-out in the Fines Tariff.

To play in either a semi-final or a final of a Cup, a registered Player must first have played in a minimum of three (3) matches in the Competition in the Playing Season.  Failure to adhere to this Rule will render the offending Player(s) being treated as ineligible.  In such circumstances, the tie will be awarded to the opposing Team and the offending Team shall be fined in accordance with the Fines Tariff and otherwise dealt with at the discretion of the Management Committee.

  <tr>
   <td>**27**.  SPECIAL CONDITIONS OF PLAY

Matches arranged by this Competition shall be played in accordance with the Laws of Association Football, with the following clarifications/amendments:



1. For U7 to U10 age groups (i.e.- Mini Soccer matches), the opposition must retreat to the halfway line when a goal kick is awarded.  However, if the goalkeeper or other Player taking the goal kick chooses to kick the ball before all the opposition Players have retreated, the ball is in play from the moment the kick is taken.
2. For U11 age groups and above, deliberate back passes into the goalkeeper’s hands are not allowed.  A free kick will be awarded if the goalkeeper touches the ball with his/her hands after it has been deliberately kicked to him/her by a team mate.   The free kick shall be taken from the penalty area line, parallel with the goal line, at the nearest point to the offence.
3. When a Player is taking a free kick or corner, all opposing Players must be at least five (5) yards from the ball until it is in play.
4. All free kicks, including the kick-off, are direct.

For U7 to U10 age groups, there will be no offside.

   </td>

  <tr>
   <td>**28.  PLAYER ID CARDS**

For all Players at U10 and above, but not for U7s, U8s or U9s, a current passport-sized photograph must be provided to the Competition when submitting the WGS Player Registration for the Playing Season.  This photograph will be used to create an ID Card for the Player in the Competition. 

ID Cards for all Players at U10 and above must be presented for inspection by the opposing Team’s manager (and by the match referee/Match Officials, if applicable) prior to play commencing.  This is a mandatory requirement of the Competition.  

If a valid ID Card is not presented prior to play commencing, the Player shall not take to the field.

  <tr>
   <td>**29.  USE OF ONLINE SYSTEMS**

In order to improve the Competition’s operational efficiency and make it easier for Clubs and Teams to participate, the Management Committee is utilising various online systems to manage the Competition’s day-to-day operation.  

These include the FA Full-Time website, which is used by the Competition to set and publish fixtures, as well as for the reporting of match results and the submission of team sheets and referee marks, etc., by Clubs and Teams.  

In addition, entry forms for Clubs and Teams into the Competition are also handled via an online system.  

Any requirements set-out in the Standard Code of Rules regarding the provision of information to the Competition by Clubs and Teams shall therefore include the submission of such information via the relevant online systems, where so specified by the Management Committee.

   <td>**30.  EVENING MATCHES AND ‘DOUBLE HEADERS’**

When extreme fixture backlog occurs, the Competition’s Fixtures Secretary, after consultation with the Management Committee, will have the power to schedule evening fixtures, and/or ‘double headers’ if teams have not previously met during the Playing Season.

Such ‘double headers’, when arranged, shall be played as two separate matches immediately following one another on the same pitch, with a ten (10) minute break in between.  Notwithstanding the venue, each Team shall play one of these matches as its ‘home’ game and shall be responsible for reporting the match result, etc., on that basis.

   <td>**31.  RELEASE FROM A FIXTURE**

Teams requiring release from a fixture on a specific date must notify the Fixtures Secretary, or the person acting on their behalf, in writing, at least four (4) weeks prior to the requested date.

Such requests will be treated on merit and release is not automatically guaranteed, and will not be entertained on more than two (2) occasions during a Playing Season.  

The final decision on such requests shall rest with the Management Committee.

   <td>**32.  TROPHY PRESENTATION EVENT**

At the close of each Playing Season, the Management Committee will arrange a Trophy Presentation event for all award-winning Teams in each competitive age group, and also for all registered Players/Teams in the non-competitive age groups.  Attendance at this event is compulsory, and any Team invited and not represented will be liable to a fine (in accordance with the Fines Tariff).

The Competition shall supply ten (10) mementos at the Trophy Presentation event for each eligible Mini Soccer Team, fourteen (14) mementos for each eligible Team participating in 9-a-side Youth Football, and sixteen (16) mementos for each eligible Team participating in 11-a-side Youth Football.

For ‘Double Header’ fixtures (see Rule 30 above), Match Officials appointed by the Competition shall be paid a match fee of £12.00 by each Team (i.e.- £24.00 in total) for 11v11 ‘double header’ fixtures, and £10.00 by each Team (i.e.- £20.00 in total) for 9v9 ‘double header’ fixtures, with the cost of any travel expenses incurred by the Match Officials shared equally between the two Teams taking part in the ‘double header’.

Please note that, in addition to the imposition of fines, other penalties may also be applicable for breaching certain Rules (e.g.- the possible deduction/award of points for failing to fulfil a fixture).   Also, certain fines (e.g.- incorrectly completed/failing to submit an online Match Return, failing to report a match result) attract an ‘accumulator’ for subsequent transgressions, which can get very expensive for repeat offenders.

...So, in summary, abide by the Rules of the League, and then you won’t get fined!  ☺

   <td>**36. SAFEGUARDING CHILDREN POLICY**

Every child or young person who plays or participates in football should be able to take part in an enjoyable and safe environment and be protected from abuse. This is the responsibility of every adult involved in football, thus every Club is required to endorse and adhere to The Sussex County Football Association’s Safeguarding Children Policy. 

The Association recognises its responsibility to safeguard the welfare of children and young people who play or participate in football by protecting them from abuse and harm. The Association is committed to working to provide a safe environment for all children and young people to participate in the sport to the best of their abilities for as long as they choose to do so.

 

The Association recognises that the terms ‘child or young person’, ‘abuse’ and ‘harm’ are open to interpretation and challenge but for the purpose of this Safeguarding Children policy they shall be defined as follows: 

**A child or young person: **‘anyone who has not yet reached their 18th birthday.’ 

**Abuse: **‘a violation of an individual’s human or civil rights by any other person or persons and, for the purposes of safeguarding children, shall include physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, bullying and hazing.’ 

**Harm: **‘Ill treatment and forms of ill treatment (including sexual abuse and forms of ill-treatment which are not physical) and also the impairment of or an avoidable deterioration in physical or mental health and the impairment of physical, intellectual, emotional, social or behavioural development.’ 

**‘Harm’** may be caused by acts of commission and acts of omission. 

The Safeguarding Children Policy is supported by The Association’s Respect programme to address verbal abuse and bullying of youngsters by parents and coaches on the side-lines. The Association’s **Safeguarding Children Policy Principles** are that: 



*   The child’s welfare is, and must always be, the paramount consideration 
*   All children and young people have a right to be protected from abuse regardless of their age, gender, disability, culture, language, race, faith, belief or sexual orientation
*   All suspicions and allegations of abuse will be taken seriously and responded to swiftly and appropriately; and
*   Working in partnership with other organisations, children and young people and their parents and carers is essential.

The Association is committed to working in partnership with the Police, Children’s Services Departments, Local Safeguarding Children’s Boards (LSCB) and the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) in accordance with their procedures. This is essential to enable these organisations to carry out their statutory duties to investigate concerns and protect all children and young people. 

The Association’s Safeguarding Children Policy is in response to government legislation and guidance, developed to safeguard the welfare and development of children and young people. 

Clubs and Leagues with youth teams must appoint a Welfare Officer in line with The Association affiliation requirements. A Club’s Welfare Officer must sit on the management committee of that Club. 

All League and Club Welfare Officers are expected to abide by the Code of Conduct for volunteer Welfare Officers.
