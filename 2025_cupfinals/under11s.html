For some this may well be the first, and possibly the only, final they appear in during their football careers. I hope that the players enjoy the excitement of the occasion and look back afterwards with pride at their performance.&nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>It would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to thank our match officials and congratulate them on their appointment to today’s match. As a league, we are extremely grateful to all the referees who officiate at our matches throughout the season. Without them the League would not be able to run as it does. Sadly, there are often insufficient “black-shirts” to cover all the matches taking place each weekend., so if anyone here today would like to know a little more about becoming a qualified referee, please do read the article later in this program.&nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;Rother League has signed up to the Football Association’s “RESPECT” campaign. Loyally accepting the decisions of the match officials is a key element of this campaign. I do understand that this is not always the easiest of things to do.

I trust everyone here today will be appropriately ‘respectful’.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>So, please enjoy the match and encourage all players. Cheer the winners, applaud the runners-ups,&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong>Finally, a big thankyou to our league sponsors Forestheath Engineering LTD&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong>Have a safe journey home.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Zak Overfield</strong></div><div><strong>Chairman</strong></div><div><strong>Rother Youth Football League</strong></div></h3>

A team can afford to slip up once or twice over the course of the season when playing for its league place, but you obviously don’t have that luxury in a knockout tournament competition format.  However, the Rother League prides itself on being regarded as a sporting League, where the F in Football stands for FUN!  Today, although there are trophies at stake, I trust that this philosophy will continue to be maintained by everyone here.</div><div><br></div><div>These occasions should never pass without a huge vote of thanks to those who have made this Cup Final possible. I’d like to say a big ‘thank you’ to the Match Referee and Assistants, who turn up, week in and week out, often suffering torrents of rain (and even, sadly, occasional abuse). They are the unsung heroes of youth football, and I trust you will all show your gratitude to them at the end of the match and your respect for them during the game.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks also go to the various Committee members who run the League and give up large chunks of their personal time (without pay!) to ensure there is a local Youth League to take part in every weekend and Cups to compete for.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, my thanks go to you, the players, parents, supporters, managers and other Club Officials who make all this possible. I do hope that, whatever the result, you enjoy your special day and that the game is played in the spirit in which it is intended.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Nigel Morris</div><div>League Secretary</div><div><br></div><div><div></div></div></h4>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">1. Isaqh Pawson – With reflexes as sharp as a cat’s, Isaqh has been a game-changer between the sticks. A big character in the squad, he thrives under pressure, pulling off crucial saves—none bigger than the ones that got us through to the semi-final.<br><br>21. Tommy Matthews – The leader of our defence, Tommy plays with a calmness beyond his years. He organises the back line with courage, and when it’s a one-on-one, there’s only ever one winner—Tommy.<br><br>18. Jake Barham – A player who never stops improving, Jake puts in the hard yards for the team. Just as effective in attack as he is in defence, he’s the kind of player every side needs—selfless, hardworking, and always switched on.<br><br>66. Arthur Buckland – A powerhouse on the pitch, Arthur is as strong as they come when it’s shoulder to shoulder. He’s got an eye for a long, raking pass and has grown into a vocal presence, leading by example at the back.<br><br>2. Ned Clarke – The engine of the team, Ned’s work rate is second to none. Covers every blade of grass, has quick feet, and is like an older brother to many of the lads—leading with his actions and presence.<br><br>9. Regan Selwood – Regan has really matured this season, evolving beyond just a goal-scorer. While he still bursts the net with sublime strikes, his work rate and Beckham-like passing ability have helped drive the team forward.<br><br>6. Huey Ramsden – A team-first player, Huey always looks for the pass rather than taking an extra touch. His link-up play brings the wingers into the game, making him a key piece of our attacking threat.<br><br>20. Euan Delves – Our top goal scorer so far this season, Euan’s left foot is pure magic. His fast feet and growing confidence have made him a real threat—he’s come into his own over the past two years.<br><br>11. Nathaniel Duffy – The team’s assist machine, Nathaniel is a lightning-fast winger who thrives on creating chances. Always making that final pass, he’s as fast and as tricky as they come and a nightmare for defenders.<br><br>3. Max Krusekopf – Calm and composed on the ball, Max has the elegance of a prime Rio Ferdinand. A lovely lad off the pitch, but don’t let that fool you—he’s ruthless in the tackle and takes no prisoners.<br><br>7. Connor Wadbrook - As tenacious as they come and whenever we have Connor with us, he gives us that bite in our play. Has played up a year since he started with P&amp;M, which is a testament to his ability.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">“What an incredible achievement for this group—reaching back-to-back Rother finals! That doesn’t happen by chance; it’s a result of the hard work, dedication, and determination these boys show every single week. Their willingness to listen, learn, and improve has been outstanding, taking on everything the coaches have asked of them and putting it into action on the pitch. Their fitness levels, teamwork, and attitude have gone to another level, and most importantly, they play for each other, showing a real togetherness that makes this team so special.<br>It has been a privilege to coach these lads, many of whom have been together for five years now. Watching them grow—not just as footballers, but as young men—has been incredibly rewarding. Their parents should be immensely proud, as they represent them brilliantly every time they step onto the pitch. A huge thank you to all the parents for the support this season, from driving to training to standing on the sidelines in all weathers, cheering them on. It doesn’t go unnoticed, and it makes a real difference. Now, with one final push, let’s go and make this season truly unforgettable!”<br><br>Managers Danny Duffy &amp; Gavin Ramsden<br><strong>Pass &amp; Move Greens</strong><br></p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">Hastings United U11 Claret</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>1. Hunter Cooper-Ford</strong><br>Hunter’s first full season as goalie and has stepped up and taken a real shine in becoming a goalie and doing extra training with the club. Hunter’s starting position is his key and always willing to go on with the attack.<br><br><strong>2. Shardi Ahmed</strong><br>Our first u10 stepping up and playing an age group above. Links up so well with the other defenders. Also willing to put his body on the line and block the shot. Doesn’t look out of place and great assets to u11’s.<br><br><strong>3. Oakley Wiggins</strong><br>Oakley transferred from Little common to the end of last season and was unable to play in last season’s cup final. Strong defenders don’t back out of challenge and link up and bring others along with him. Very passionate and want to win every tackle.<br><br><strong>5. Lucius Loureiro</strong><br>Great attitude and true leader and new club Captain within the squad, technically gifted and able to use both feet. Reads the game and vision of the next motion of play is unreal. Strong and has really kicked on this season. MOM is coming.<br> <br><strong>6. Jakob Felsted</strong><br>Our second u10 player loves the ball at his feet and scanning is his thing, low center of gravity makes Jakob move around the pitch with ease. Linking up in center midfield with others. Jakob is odds on to get an assist.<br><br><strong>10. Ellis Suggitt</strong><br>Our 3rd and final u10, Ellis has the right eye for goal and works hard to create chances. Ellis has been a real impact player for us and if Ellis starts or comes off the bench then the other team will be in trouble.<br><br><strong>11. Adam Faris</strong><br>Adam has been pushing up with u12’s and well deserved, currently on trials with Chelsea FC and a promising player. Will play any position he’s required. Technically gifted player and most promising prospect for the u11’s. cover every blade of grass on the pitch and is blessed with natural pace.<br><br><strong>15. Rueben Robinson</strong><br>A giant in the middle of the park, other players can’t get near him. First season with Hastings and a bright future. More assists this season with the Sunday team. Could Rueben be on the score sheet today.<br><br><strong>39. Noah Madge</strong><br>A left sided defender, a proper old school defender, never backs out of a crunching challenge. Noah’s improvement in the last 12 months put his name first on the team sheet. Clean sheet incoming.<br> <br><strong>48. Oliver Fortunato</strong><br>First season with the team and moving from the blue’s, Oliver hasn’t looked out of place. Can play in any position he’s required to defend, midfield and even attacking player. Oliver listens and always puts the hard work into training. Keen to start in the cup Final.<br> <br><strong>55. Dougie Kingshott</strong><br>Dougie was voted the most improved player last year, the Saturday league has really given him a second breath of energy. 1v1’s there is only one winner and that’s Dougie. Having most of his success on the wing. First full season and one to watch in the final.<br><br><strong>57. Malachi Hawkins</strong><br>Malachi getting the winner last season in cup final, Malachi has developed a lot and moving form defense to winger. Once the confidence comes this is when Malachi is at his best? Will he get the winner today?<br> <br><strong>Oliver Wenham-Vale, Freddie Salmon and Reggie Clarke </strong><br>All are unable to play today due to not having enough league games. Oliver is new to the team. Freddie Sammon u10’s only player in 2 league games and scoring 3 goals. Reggie transferred from Little Common and was very new to the squad. <br><br><br><br><br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Reaching the final is a testament to the commitment of every player and supporter who has stood by us through thick and thin. Together, we have overcome formidable opponents, battled through adversity, and demonstrated the resilience and determination that define our club with using u10’s playing in the u11’s Rother league, shows the development plan the club have.<br><br>But as we stand on the brink of glory, let us not forget the journey that has brought us here scoring over 20+ goals in the cup run. The development this team has created since taking charge 3 seasons ago, gone from losing every game to winning some cracking games.<br> <br>I would like to thank all players, parents, guardians, supporters and the club for backing me and my son Taylor Field for supporting and working Father and son to develop this team into a proven winner.<br><br>This team has been playing the Hastings United morals all season and this has got us to the final.<br><br>Hope you all have a great day, and support Hastings United, to bring the trophy home!<br><br>Tony Field<br><strong>Manager</strong><br> <br>Taylor Field<br><strong>Assistant Manager&nbsp;</strong><br></p>
