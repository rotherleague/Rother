I sincerely hope that everyone enjoys the occasion, and that – win or lose – you all leave after today’s match with good memories of an enjoyable and entertaining game.&nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;I would like to congratulate both teams on reaching today’s final. For some this may well be the first, and possibly the only, final they appear in during their football careers. I hope that the players enjoy the excitement of the occasion and look back afterwards with pride at their performance.&nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>It would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to thank our match officials and congratulate them on their appointment to today’s match. As a league, we are extremely grateful to all the referees who officiate at our matches throughout the season. Without them the League would not be able to run as it does. Sadly, there are often insufficient “black-shirts” to cover all the matches taking place each weekend., so if anyone here today would like to know a little more about becoming a qualified referee, please do read the article later in this program.&nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;Rother League has signed up to the Football Association’s “RESPECT” campaign. Loyally accepting the decisions of the match officials is a key element of this campaign. I do understand that this is not always the easiest of things to do. Football is a passionate and emotive sport, but life is all about learning that things do not always go the way we choose. I trust everyone here today will be appropriately ‘respectful’.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>So, please enjoy the match and encourage all players. Cheer the winners, applaud the runners-ups,&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong>Finally, a big thankyou to our league sponsors Forestheath Engineering LTD&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong>Have a safe journey home.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Zak Overfield</strong></div><div><strong>Chairman</strong></div><div><strong>Rother Youth Football League</strong></div></h3>

A team can afford to slip up once or twice over the course of the season when playing for its league place, but you obviously don’t have that luxury in a knockout tournament competition format.  However, the Rother League prides itself on being regarded as a sporting League, where the F in Football stands for FUN!  Today, although there are trophies at stake, I trust that this philosophy will continue to be maintained by everyone here.</div><div><br></div><div>These occasions should never pass without a huge vote of thanks to those who have made this Cup Final possible. I’d like to say a big ‘thank you’ to the Match Referee and Assistants, who turn up, week in and week out, often suffering torrents of rain (and even, sadly, occasional abuse). They are the unsung heroes of youth football, and I trust you will all show your gratitude to them at the end of the match and your respect for them during the game.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks also go to the various Committee members who run the League and give up large chunks of their personal time (without pay!) to ensure there is a local Youth League to take part in every weekend and Cups to compete for.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, my thanks go to you, the players, parents, supporters, managers and other Club Officials who make all this possible. I do hope that, whatever the result, you enjoy your special day and that the game is played in the spirit in which it is intended.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><br><div><br></div><div>Nigel Morris</div><div>League Secretary</div><div><br></div><div><div></div></div></h4>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">1. Raf Smith (22)<br>Became our number 1 midway through the season and has been improving ever since. Has a great <br>relationship with the two defenders in front of him and is a great shot stopper!<br><br>2. Charlie Monk (36) (Captain)<br>Charlie is our captain because he leads by example showing composure in moving the ball, and brings a sense of calmness to the game. This season he has improved his strength in the tackle and become a rock at the back.<br><br>3. Danil Spiels (32)<br>Danil has shown huge improvements this season and has become a regular in the backline. He is ferocious in trying to win the ball back and has really improved with the ball.<br><br>3. Zak Cornwall (32)<br>Zak is our left footed maestro, he likes to bomb down the wing and deliver into the box. Zak has great strength on the ball, quick feet and gets on the score sheet with his powerful strikes.<br><br>5. Ted Grech (24)<br>Our engine in the midfield, Ted will not stop working from the first whistle to the last, Ted is strong in the tackle, a good passer and also has an eye for goal!<br><br>6. Stanley Goldsmith (36)<br>Stan is a player who can play anywhere and do a job, but his favourite position is on the left wing where he can cut across goal. Stan has some tricky feet to go past his opposition and regularly gets on the scoresheet.<br><br>7. Ted Robinson (26)<br>Robbo is another that has shown big improvements this season. Ted can be deployed in multiple positions but his favourite is to play on the right wing where he can whip in crosses or go for goal with his wand of a right foot. He is also a bit of a free kick specialist!<br><br>8. Nathan Woodley (30)<br>Mr Goals. Nathan leads the line for the team and has a prolific goal scoring record. Nathan has a natural instinct for goal and score from pretty much anywhere. He also presses well from the front and has great desire to get the ball back for his team.<br><br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">“This has been a fantastic season for the blues so far. A new coach with different ideas you never know how they are going to respond but in our first competitive outing together they took home a trophy at the Little Common tournament. The boys started the season slowly getting mixed results but have since really grown into a great footballing side with results to match. This team will try to play good football no matter the opposition or conditions and they are a fantastic group. They are a real pleasure to coach and are a credit to themselves and their parents.”<br><br>“ I would like to thank all of our sponsors, East Sussex College and Skiltek . I would also like to thank all of the parents that make sure the boys attend training, matches and have the support they need to grow into good footballers.”<br><br>Kiran Monk<br>Manager, Hastings United U10 Blue<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">No.1 – Stanley Pearce (Goalkeeper)<br>Stanley is a brave and instinctive goalkeeper who’s never afraid to put himself on the line. With sharp reactions and great vision, he’s always ready to pull off a big save. Full of fun and cheeky charm, Stanley brings great energy to the squad.<br><br>No.10 – Archie Brassell (Right-Sided Defender)<br>Bravery, brains, and boundless energy – Archie is a defender who loves a crunching tackle just as much as a marauding run upfield. His ability to read the game is second to none, and he plays with humour, heart, and a hint of flair every time he pulls on the shirt.<br><br>No.15 – Maddison Neal (Left-Sided Defender)<br>A warrior at the back and a willing attacker when needed, Maddison plays with strength, heart, and a “none shall pass” mentality. Fiercely competitive and always learning, she leads by example with her tireless work rate and fearless style of play.<br><br>No.4 – Jake Winchester (Central Midfielder)<br>Jake is the heartbeat of the team – a true midfield general. With incredible vision, composure, and intelligence, he controls the tempo and inspires those around him. A natural leader who raises the standard, Jake brings his A-game every single week.<br><br>No.9 – Theo Weston (Right Wing)<br>Theo brings flair and finesse to the wing with his silky first touch and pinpoint delivery. His Beckham-esque crosses cause chaos in the box, and his clever link-up play keeps defenders guessing. With a cheeky charm to match his talent, Theo’s always a joy to watch.<br><br>No.8 – Woody Pepper (Left Wing)<br>Quick, direct, and fearless – Woody glides past defenders with ease, whether cutting in or hitting the byline. He’s got a thunderous shot, superb vision, and a determination to match. Oh, and his dancing? Just as good as his football!<br><br>No.5 – Parker Thomas (Centre Forward)<br>Don’t be fooled by the angelic face – Parker is a ruthless finisher with a nose for goal. A classic fox in the box, he battles for every ball, beats players with ease, and never stops running. Polite, hardworking, and born to score.<br><br>No.16 – Jack Kelsey (Centre Forward)<br>Jack is quick, strong, and always looking to make things happen up front. With great athleticism and a powerful, direct playing style, he’s a constant threat to defenders. A no-nonsense striker who loves the game and gives it everything he's got.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">This brilliant group of players has been growing together since their Under 7 days, gradually evolving from a chaotic, joyful swarm chasing the ball with dreams of scoring (we all remember those days!😂) into a fantastic, well-balanced team that plays the game the right way.<br><br>Over the years, we’ve welcomed new faces — each one bringing something unique to the squad — and together, they’ve built something special. They’ve learned to trust one another, support each other through every match, and understand what it means to be part of a team. They work hard, they compete fiercely, and — win or lose — they do it together. Whether it’s a last-minute goal or a tough defeat, they celebrate as one and lift each other up when it’s needed most. Most importantly, they play to have fun!<br><br>This season, something has really clicked. The passing, the movement, the slick team play—it’s a joy to watch and proof that they’re learning how rewarding and exciting it is to play proper, team-focused football.<br><br>The energy these players bring is infectious... though we’ll admit, it occasionally spills over into a little too much energy during training (we’re pretty sure every grass roots coach out there knows what we mean😉).<br><br>Behind every good team is a great support system, and we’re incredibly lucky to have a group of parents who are nothing short of brilliant. Their encouragement, trust, and positive attitude make the coaching experience not only easier but genuinely fun. The kids feed off that atmosphere, and it shows in the way they play - with a smile.<br><br>Our message to the team today will be the same as it always is: Try your best, play as a team and have fun! We couldn’t be prouder of how far they've come — and the best part? They’re just getting started.<br><br>Enjoy the game, everyone. ⚽️🙌<br><br>Danny Pepper &amp; Lloyd Weston<br>Managers, Westfield FC U10s<br></p>
