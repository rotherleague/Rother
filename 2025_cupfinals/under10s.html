I sincerely hope that everyone enjoys the occasion, and that – win or lose – you all leave after today’s match with good memories of an enjoyable and entertaining game.&nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;I would like to congratulate both teams on reaching today’s final. For some this may well be the first, and possibly the only, final they appear in during their football careers. I hope that the players enjoy the excitement of the occasion and look back afterwards with pride at their performance.&nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>It would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to thank our match officials and congratulate them on their appointment to today’s match. As a league, we are extremely grateful to all the referees who officiate at our matches throughout the season. Without them the League would not be able to run as it does. Sadly, there are often insufficient “black-shirts” to cover all the matches taking place each weekend., so if anyone here today would like to know a little more about becoming a qualified referee, please do read the article later in this program.&nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;Rother League has signed up to the Football Association’s “RESPECT” campaign. Loyally accepting the decisions of the match officials is a key element of this campaign. I do understand that this is not always the easiest of things to do. Football is a passionate and emotive sport, but life is all about learning that things do not always go the way we choose. I trust everyone here today will be appropriately ‘respectful’.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>So, please enjoy the match and encourage all players. Cheer the winners, applaud the runners-ups,&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong>Finally, a big thankyou to our league sponsors Forestheath Engineering LTD&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong>Have a safe journey home.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Zak Overfield</strong></div><div><strong>Chairman</strong></div><div><strong>Rother Youth Football League</strong></div></h3>

After all, that is really all that matters.</div><div><br></div><div>I’d also like to give my wholehearted congratulations to both AS Eastbourne U10 and Hailsham Town U10 Stringers on getting through to today’s final.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cup football, at all levels of the game, is often more exciting simply because of the ‘sudden death’ element. A team can afford to slip up once or twice over the course of the season when playing for its league place, but you obviously don’t have that luxury in a knockout tournament competition format.  However, the Rother League prides itself on being regarded as a sporting League, where the F in Football stands for FUN!  Today, although there are trophies at stake, I trust that this philosophy will continue to be maintained by everyone here.</div><div><br></div><div>These occasions should never pass without a huge vote of thanks to those who have made this Cup Final possible. I’d like to say a big ‘thank you’ to the Match Referee and Assistants, who turn up, week in and week out, often suffering torrents of rain (and even, sadly, occasional abuse). They are the unsung heroes of youth football, and I trust you will all show your gratitude to them at the end of the match and your respect for them during the game.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks also go to the various Committee members who run the League and give up large chunks of their personal time (without pay!) to ensure there is a local Youth League to take part in every weekend and Cups to compete for.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, my thanks go to you, the players, parents, supporters, managers and other Club Officials who make all this possible. I do hope that, whatever the result, you enjoy your special day and that the game is played in the spirit in which it is intended.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><br><div><br></div><div>Nigel Morris</div><div>League Secretary</div><div><br></div><div><div></div></div></h4>

We have truly witnessed the players develop and grow together as a team, which has been a delight to watch.<br> <br>The younger age groups are non-competitive, so it's always wonderful to have a successful cup run and enjoy a special day out at the end of the season. We are incredibly proud of each and every one of the U10 players this season. They have worked hard, and their efforts have definitely paid off.<br> <br>We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to both the parents and the players for their continued support and dedication to training and matches.

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">Hailsham Town U10 Stringers</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>1. Freddie Heath</strong><br>Has been our dedicated goalie for a few seasons now and is showing great signs of being a fantastic all round goalkeeper, great shot stopper!<br><br><strong>4. Magnus Martin</strong><br>A very strong defender with a great passing range. Also likes to get forward when he can and possesses one hell of a strike!<br><br><strong>5. Emily Brazil<br></strong>A real fan favourite after winning the spectators award last season, Emily has great technical ability but also loves to get stuck in as well.<br><br><strong>6. Farrell Reardon-Tulley<br></strong>A solid defender who loves to drive forward with the ball, a great reader of the game and positions himself to steal the ball back from the opposition.<br><br><strong>7. Oscar Cruttenden<br></strong>A worthy winner of last season's managers Player of the Year award, Oscar is a fantastic player with great ability. Expect to see flair and some goal bound efforts bending into the top bins!<br><br><strong>8. Toby Kent<br></strong>Hailsham Town's very own Mr Duracell Bunny, Toby gives 110% every single time he steps onto the pitch. He has a great desire to win the ball back and drive down the wing!<br><br><strong>10. Harrison Keith<br></strong>Mr Dynamo, club Captain, and is a natural leader both on and off the pitch. You can’t fault his work rate both in matches and training. Loves breaking up play and driving forward looking for a through ball or a strike from outside the box with either foot.<br><br><strong>11. Vinny Blackman<br></strong>Vinny is one of our new players this season and has hit the ground running since first putting on the Hailsham Town Youth shirt. He’s been in unbelievable form in front of goal and I'm going to need a calculator to add up his goal tally at the end of the season.<br><br><strong>12. Ernie Phillips<br></strong>Has a wand of a left foot! He can play on the wings or as a striker, loves to drive with the ball at pace to either whip a ball in the box or drive to goal to get a strike away.<br><br><strong>14. Hugo Simpson<br></strong>A versatile player who has the ability to play in defence or on the wing, Hugo has been in great form this season and is strong in the tackle but can also whip an excellent cross in with pin point accuracy.<br><br><strong>15. Buddy Attrell<br></strong>Another new player to Hailsham Town Youth this season, Buddy is a fantastic character within the group. He has superb technical skills but isn’t afraid to get stuck into the challenges or a long range strike at goal.<br><br><br><br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">“This season has been fantastic. We have seen the players develop week after week, improving all the time and growing together as a team. They have continued to get better and better as the season has progressed. It has been a delight to watch. They are a fantastic group to coach and always give a 110% either at training or on match day. The thing I love most about this team is that they never know when they are beaten and give absolutely everything right up until the final whistle!<br><br>We would like to say a big thank you to Ben Cruttenden at CR Construction, Lee Simpson at Choice Vehicle Rentals, and Vinny Blackman at On Top Scaffolding LTD. Last but not least we would like to thank the parents and the players for their continued support and dedication towards training and matches. We could not do this without you.”<br><br>Dean Keith<br><strong>Manager, Hailsham Town Youth Stringers<br></strong><br><br><br></p>
