Fingers crossed that the weather, for today at least, stays fine!</div><div><br></div><br><div>I would like to take this opportunity to recognise and thank everyone connected with Bexhill FC for providing the facilities here today. I’m sure that the surroundings, together with the support of the crowd, will lead to all the players having a day to remember and treasure. After all, that is really all that matters.</div><div><br></div><div>I’d also like to give my wholehearted congratulations to both Insulators U15 and The Junior Club Tackleway Youth U15 on getting through to today’s final.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cup football, at all levels of the game, is often more exciting simply because of the ‘sudden death’ element. A team can afford to slip up once or twice over the course of the season when playing for its league place, but you obviously don’t have that luxury in a knockout tournament competition format. However, the Rother League prides itself on being regarded as a sporting League, where the F in Football stands for FUN! Today, although there are trophies at stake, I trust that this philosophy will continue to be maintained by everyone here.</div><div><br></div><div>These occasions should never pass without a huge vote of thanks to those who have made this Cup Final possible. I’d like to say a big ‘thank you’ to the Match Referee and Assistants, who turn up, week in and week out, often suffering torrents of rain (and even, sadly, occasional abuse). They are the unsung heroes of youth football, and I trust you will all show your gratitude to them at the end of the match and your respect for them during the game.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks also go to the various Committee members who run the League and give up large chunks of their personal time (without pay!) to ensure there is a local Youth League to take part in every weekend and Cups to compete for.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, my thanks go to you, the players, parents, supporters, managers and other Club Officials who make all this possible. I do hope that, whatever the result, you enjoy your special day and that the game is played in the spirit in which it is intended.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Nigel Morris</div><div>League Secretary</div><div><br></div><div><div></div></div></h4>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">Insulators U15’s</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">1. George Amos - Opening up the lineup for us, is our goalkeeper and voice of the team George. Tall, strong and agile would be the main characteristics of our superb gk. George has been playing in goal since the end of last season and his talk and encouragement during the games has given the lads the drive to push on. <br><br>2. Clayton Burchell - One of the new additions for this season and a very welcome one. Clayton came into the team during the summer and soon impressed the coaches with his football brain. Setting himself to start in defence and then moving further forward into a CDM role, showing his capabilities and range. A true competitor.<br><br>4. Freddie Flynn - Quick feet, nimble and like a bouncy ball, Fred glides through players and can move the ball effectively from defence to attack. Don’t be fooled by his size, you can knock him down, but he’ll get straight back up again. He’ll open space and feed the play all day long.<br><br>5. John Fuller - John has great vision in his passing and utilises every tool at his disposal to give our team the edge when attacking. Combining with the other midfielders to support our defence is another asset he provides. His football intelligence is years above his age and stands out in any team. <br><br>6. Lucas Golding - Settling into his 2nd season playing a year up and moving into the right back position has given Lucas and the team a confidence to play out and wide. A determined character and his progression over the last 2 seasons has been very impressive. Mr reliable.<br><br>7. Toby Wheeler - Our 2nd lad playing up a year and another new addition. Size is of no matter to Toby, as by the time you look down, the ball is in the back of the net. His cheeky nature is clear on and off the pitch and has melded into the team seamlessly.<br><br>8. Eduardo Hollands - After playing every position for the team last season (even in goal), Eduardo has fitted into centre back like a glove! His displays over this season have been nothing short of excellent and alongside his partners at the back, he has solidified an already iron like defence.<br><br>9. Oscar Hollis - Our attacking Oscar. Across the midfield or up top, you always know that you are going to get 100% effort, energy and style with Oscar. Goals from everywhere and his ability to keep the ball is superb. Don’t be fooled by his polite approach, he plays to win.<br><br>10. Albie Howe - The 3rd of our boys playing up a year. Coming in at the start of the season and looking to find his way into the team, Albie has shown that he can perform anywhere in the attacking line up. Pace and precision are his game!<br><br>11. Wilfred Kent - Last years battling midfielder to this year’s centre back rock. Although he might look like a chilled surfer dude, his courage, ferociousness and desire cannot be beaten. Adding goals into the mix makes Wilfred an asset for every game. He’s also playing up a year 😊<br><br>12. Nathan Palmer - He might look shy and quiet but with the ball at his feet Nathan can make the right pass or the right shot at the right time. Never happy missing opportunities and works hard all season long developing his game to better himself.<br><br>18. Louis Wilkins - The left wing wizard! His pace and banter are on fire and he backs up it with a sweet left foot. His crosses are always accurate and he can easily progress into the centre forward role to offer something different. A great weapon in our arsenal. <br><br>19. Ryley Bateman (Captain) - The midfield general – Ryley. Over the course of the season, Ryley’s displays of athleticism, skill and tenacity have proved vital for our team’s performance. Running the midfield has become his bread and butter and has become a guiding figure for the other boys. Our Captain and Leader!<br><br>20. Woody Lock - Last years gk and this year’s striker! Our top goalscorer so far and yes he is also playing up a year! The engine on Woody never stops and he is becoming a true athlete. Strength, power and dynamism give him a huge edge on any defenders. You’ll also see him working hard to cover ground and support his team!<br><br>21. Sam Hayes - The last of the new additions for this season and yes, our last lad playing up a year. Sam came into the team in the summer and quickly bonded with the lads. He has pace, both footed and a tenacious attitude that has seen him deliver some outstanding performances this season.<br><br><br><br><br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Only our 2nd season as a team and here we are in our 2nd successive cup final. Well done boys, that’s some achievement!! Although a strange season with only 4 teams remaining in the league, the boys have stayed focused and worked hard every week, whether in training or matches to keep driving forward to the end of the season.<br> <br>The desire from the boys to get to this cup final has been fantastic and as one of their coaches I have been proud to see their development grow even further this season.<br><br>As a management team we’d like to thank all of our supporters, the parents, the team, the committee and everyone who has been involved in making another year so positive and possible for these young lads. And from me to the other coaches and welfare staff – thanks gents!<br>#UPTHESLATORS<br><br>Scott Golding<br>Manager, Insulators U15’s<br></p>
