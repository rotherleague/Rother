For some this may well be the first, and possibly the only, final they appear in during their football careers. I hope that the players enjoy the excitement of the occasion and look back afterwards with pride at their performance.&nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>It would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to thank our match officials and congratulate them on their appointment to today’s match. As a league, we are extremely grateful to all the referees who officiate at our matches throughout the season. Without them the League would not be able to run as it does. Sadly, there are often insufficient “black-shirts” to cover all the matches taking place each weekend., so if anyone here today would like to know a little more about becoming a qualified referee, please do read the article later in this program.&nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;Rother League has signed up to the Football Association’s “RESPECT” campaign. Loyally accepting the decisions of the match officials is a key element of this campaign. I do understand that this is not always the easiest of things to do. Football is a passionate and emotive sport, but life is all about learning that things do not always go the way we choose. I trust everyone here today will be appropriately ‘respectful’.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>So, please enjoy the match and encourage all players. Cheer the winners, applaud the runners-ups,&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong>Finally, a big thankyou to our league sponsors Forestheath Engineering LTD&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong>Have a safe journey home.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Zak Overfield</strong></div><div><strong>Chairman</strong></div><div><strong>Rother Youth Football League</strong></div></h3>

A team can afford to slip up once or twice over the course of the season when playing for its league place, but you obviously don’t have that luxury in a knockout tournament competition format.  However, the Rother League prides itself on being regarded as a sporting League, where the F in Football stands for FUN!  Today, although there are trophies at stake, I trust that this philosophy will continue to be maintained by everyone here.</div><div><br></div><div>These occasions should never pass without a huge vote of thanks to those who have made this Cup Final possible. I’d like to say a big ‘thank you’ to the Match Referee and Assistants, who turn up, week in and week out, often suffering torrents of rain (and even, sadly, occasional abuse). They are the unsung heroes of youth football, and I trust you will all show your gratitude to them at the end of the match and your respect for them during the game.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks also go to the various Committee members who run the League and give up large chunks of their personal time (without pay!) to ensure there is a local Youth League to take part in every weekend and Cups to compete for.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, my thanks go to you, the players, parents, supporters, managers and other Club Officials who make all this possible. I do hope that, whatever the result, you enjoy your special day and that the game is played in the spirit in which it is intended.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Nigel Morris</div><div>League Secretary</div><div><br></div><div><div></div></div></h4>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">1. Jonty Baxter<br>Joined us at the start of the season and hasn’t missed a minute since. A proper pro, with an elite attitude.<br><br>12. Allen Adeyinka<br>A holding midfielder who possesses great strength. Has become an integral part of the team through hard work and determination. Hasn’t lost a tackle since 2021.<br><br>7. Eddie Bradford<br>Has improved immeasurably this season, becoming a key player. A wing wizard, with a great product. Eddie’s performance in the Semi-Final was a big reason for us getting here today.<br><br>20. Jack Maryan<br>Mr versatile. Jack can play LB/RB/CB/CM/CF and shows his fantastic football brain in all positions.<br><br>6. David Pamberi<br>The king of the ball roll. David has really excelled since joining us in the summer, his 1v1’s are a joy to watch.<br><br>5. Luca Micheal<br>The most consistent player in the team. Luca brings a good performance, communication, punctuality, and good energy with him to every game and spreads it amongst the team from his arrival, until the cool down.<br><br>2. Rhys Creasey<br>An EMC legend. Rhys has been with EMC since lockdown zoom sessions, and hasn’t looked back since. The heart of our defence, but is also comfortable stepping into midfield on the ball.<br><br>12. Rafe Coleman<br>Rafe, who is currently on trial with Gillingham FC, misses today’s final through injury. We look forward to his return during the league run-in.<br><br>10. Diogo Donnis<br>Similar to his namesake Diogo Jota, a very tidy finisher, who will be active in and around the oppositions penalty area at all times.<br><br>22. Henry Deakin<br>Henry is the engine room of the team. A workhorse who is very reliable in lots of positions, and is comfortable on the ball in tight areas.<br><br>10*. Jax Clark<br>A new signing this summer, who replaced the outgoing Albert. Jax has skills and trickery to match his pace and power in the final 3rd.<br><br>27. Jason Adhikari<br>A fox in the box. Jason is a lethal finisher. Again very versatile (Jason was a regular goalkeeper before Jonty’s arrival and can do a job anywhere on the pitch).<br><br>13. Cole Dulski.<br>The Rother League’s very own Kevin De-Bryne. Cole’s vision and weight of pass make him the technician of this very technical team.<br><br>47. Oliver Woodham ©<br>Oliver will captain today’s team in Rafe’s absence. Oliver eat, sleeps and breathes EMC and is always updating his coach on upcoming fixtures etc. A pleasure to coach.<br><br>17. Mathew Berger<br>Mathew has excelled this season in right wing and as a right back. His athleticism makes him a real handful to play against.<br><br>11. Harry Archer<br>Harry has developed very well in our U13 KYL squad this season since converting into a striker. We are really proud of the progress he continues to make.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">“Good afternoon all and thank you for joining us for today’s game, for which will be this squad’s first ever cup final.<br>We have had a fantastic season at U12 this season with the players developing at an unbelievable speed, including Albert Watmore who has gone on to sign for Premier League Club Crystal Palace FC.<br>I would like to thank all the parents for their fantastic support, especially our linesman David Baxter.<br>We have always had great games against Hastings United, played in the right spirit, with them providing a good test for us and look forward to the same again today. Hastings have a fantastic front line, with lots of pace. We will have to try to keep them quiet if we want any chance of a win.<br><br>Enjoy the game.<br><br>Jonny Elwood<br>Manager, EMC</p>
