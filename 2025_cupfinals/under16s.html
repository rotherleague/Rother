I sincerely hope that everyone enjoys the occasion, and that – win or lose – you all leave after today’s match with good memories of an enjoyable and entertaining game.&nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;I would like to congratulate both teams on reaching today’s final. For some this may well be the first, and possibly the only, final they appear in during their football careers. I hope that the players enjoy the excitement of the occasion and look back afterwards with pride at their performance.&nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>It would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to thank our match officials and congratulate them on their appointment to today’s match. As a league, we are extremely grateful to all the referees who officiate at our matches throughout the season. Without them the League would not be able to run as it does. Sadly, there are often insufficient “black-shirts” to cover all the matches taking place each weekend., so if anyone here today would like to know a little more about becoming a qualified referee, please do read the article later in this program.&nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;Rother League has signed up to the Football Association’s “RESPECT” campaign. Loyally accepting the decisions of the match officials is a key element of this campaign. I do understand that this is not always the easiest of things to do. Football is a passionate and emotive sport, but life is all about learning that things do not always go the way we choose. I trust everyone here today will be appropriately ‘respectful’.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>So, please enjoy the match and encourage all players. Cheer the winners, applaud the runners-ups,&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong>Finally, a big thankyou to our league sponsors Forestheath Engineering LTD&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong>Have a safe journey home.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Zak Overfield</strong></div><div><strong>Chairman</strong></div><div><strong>Rother Youth Football League</strong></div></h3>

After all, that is really all that matters.</div><div><br></div><div>I’d also like to give my wholehearted congratulations to both Rye Bay U16 and AFC Varndeanians U16 Red on getting through to today’s final.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Cup football, at all levels of the game, is often more exciting simply because of the ‘sudden death’ element. A team can afford to slip up once or twice over the course of the season when playing for its league place, but you obviously don’t have that luxury in a knockout tournament competition format.  However, the Rother League prides itself on being regarded as a sporting League, where the F in Football stands for FUN!  Today, although there are trophies at stake, I trust that this philosophy will continue to be maintained by everyone here.</div><div><br></div><div>These occasions should never pass without a huge vote of thanks to those who have made this Cup Final possible. I’d like to say a big ‘thank you’ to the Match Referee and Assistants, who turn up, week in and week out, often suffering torrents of rain (and even, sadly, occasional abuse). They are the unsung heroes of youth football, and I trust you will all show your gratitude to them at the end of the match and your respect for them during the game.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks also go to the various Committee members who run the League and give up large chunks of their personal time (without pay!) to ensure there is a local Youth League to take part in every weekend and Cups to compete for.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, my thanks go to you, the players, parents, supporters, managers and other Club Officials who make all this possible. I do hope that, whatever the result, you enjoy your special day and that the game is played in the spirit in which it is intended.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Nigel Morris</div><div>League Secretary</div><div><br></div><div><div></div></div></h4>

Theo has improved massively with his decision making on when to come and collect.<br><br>8. Tom Breen<br>A holding midfielder who has strength and skill. He doesn’t mind doing the dirty work and getting stuck in. Has a really good attitude towards learning the game.<br><br>3. Max Massey<br>Max has worked hard this season on his all round game and it has paid off for him. Very good positionally and getting better every week. <br><br>4. Tyler Bourne<br>Captain and no nonsense centre back. Refuses to be beaten in a 1v1. Communicates well with his team and is a natural leader.<br><br>17. George Payne<br>Arrived at the club at the start of the season and has been brilliant. Full of energy and always motivating his team mates.<br><br>14. Archie Catt<br>Archie is a beast in midfield, strong and energetic. Loves a tackle and has an eye for a goal. <br><br>11. Albert House <br>Albert covers every blade of grass, his workrate is outstanding. Blessed with natural talent. When Albert plays well the team follows.<br><br>12. Max Bado<br>Max is an athlete. He’s tall, quick and skillful. He controls the tempo of games and dictates the play. A very important player.<br><br>10. Alfie Mason<br>A clinical finisher, and clever striker. He puts pressure on the defenders with his workrate, and is happy to drop deep to get involved.<br><br>7. Cody Lacey<br>Assistant captain. A technically gifted player with blistering pace to burn. Always backs himself in any situation. Goal machine.<br><br>9. Jake Leyland<br>A defender's knightmare. Has outstanding footwork and will drive at opponents as often as possible. Creates lots of chances for team mates from the wing.<br><br>15. Eddie Millar<br>Most improved player this season. He doesn’t complicate things, just plays simple but effective. Has loads of energy and will run all day.<br><br>16. Alex Burgess<br>A versatile player who can pop up with a goal. Gives 100% every time he plays. <br><br>2. Ralph Milton<br>Another versatile player who is just as good on the wing as he is in defence. He’s calm in possession of the ball and will always look to play forwards.<br><br>5. Frankie Gall<br>Frankie will put his body on the line for his team mates. Wears his heart on his sleeve and always gives his best.<br><br>6. Harry Sullivan<br>Harry has good ball mastery skills and has been working hard on speeding up his decision making.

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">AFC Varndeanians U16 Red</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">1. Henry Boyle - GK<br> Henry has had a superb season, he's made important saves in key moments and has been very consistent all year and as a result has been called into the U18s a number of times.  <br><br>2. Diego Garcia<br> Stepped into CB this season and has made the role his own.  Excellent in the air and quality with the ball when playing out from the back.<br><br>3. Luca Begg<br>Centre Back.  Team captain and imposing figure at the back, very vocal and a superb influence on the team.  The biggest compliment we can pay him is how much we miss him when he isn't there.<br><br>4. Noah Wilkie<br>Full back.  Noah has real quality with the ball, very quick feet and very intelligent when faced with one on ones.  Versatile, he can play either side and higher up the pitch and you'll often find him marauding into the opposition box.<br><br>5. Alex Gray<br>CDM. Making Alex a dedicated defensive midfielder changed our season.  He's a natural winner and has been superb in that role with his positioning and distribution.  His positional discipline and passing has allowed others more freedom to play.<br><br>6. Harry Brand<br>CAM.  H as he is known has real technical quality, a bit of a maverick at times he can pop up all over the pitch.  He scores goals, assists, can help out defensively and that is down to his understanding of the game.  He's thrived this season and has become an important part of the men's reserves at the club already scoring double figures in just 4 and a half games.<br><br>7. Louie Johnstone<br> CM.  Technically brilliant, his improvement this season has been immense.  At his best he sets the tempo, he provides clever link up play with a brilliant passing range.  His desire to get forward more this year has seen an impressive tally of goals as well.<br><br>8. Harry Tuck<br>Full back.  Very aggressive, committed player. He's been coached by Rob since U7s and has had a brilliant season, even the best wide players have found it difficult against him.<br><br>9. Sean Holland.<br>CAM. A natural finisher and excellent footballing brain, drops in, always available for those around him. Great eye for a pass and a knightmare for Defenders to pick up with his movement.<br><br>10. Frankie Prince<br>Capable of moments of absolute magic on his day, passes and goals that are beyond most players.  He is strong and quick and has all of the attributes to cause defenders nightmares when he is on his game.<br><br>11. Harvey Byram<br>A Versatile player. Can play across the midfield and higher up the pitch, plenty of tricks, with quick feet causes opposition constant problems.<br><br>12. Jack Lyon<br>Another who has been coached by Rob since U7s.  Very intelligent player who is at his best playing short passes and linking up the play, his clever one and two touch passes allow others to receive the ball early in space.<br><br>13. Sidney Wilson<br>Coached by Steve since U7s.  Physically very strong and quick with good feet.  His upward trajectory over the last few years has been very impressive to watch and he's becoming more and more consistent.  He is causing all sorts of problems for full backs with his strength and speed in both youth and men's football.<br><br>14. Essien Tyson<br>Dynamic wide player, Essie brilliant at receiving the ball in tight spaces and using defenders getting close to him to his advantage.  He plays with a lot of energy and a high intensity.  He is constantly fouled as that is the only way opponents can deal with him.<br><br>15. Marlon Aviles<br>Livewire forward with an immense work ethic.  This is Marlon's first season in the group and he always injects a lot of energy into our performances with his pressing and desire.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">“This season has had many ups and downs. Our focus has been on giving the players the right environment to develop, we have been really pleased with the group and the way they have grown throughout the season with some excellent, memorable results along the way, this has seen players get opportunities to play and experience U18 &amp; mens football, all of which is a great experience for the young group. Our football at times has been excellent and a joy to watch and we are very proud of the group and how they have been playing, it’s a big weekend for them with tonight’s cup final and another on Sunday! Come on the V’s!!<br><br>We would like to say a big thank you to Mike Brand and Scott Johnston for the help given throughout the season as well as all the parents without them none of this would be possible! Also to AFC Varndeanians, it is our first season with the club and they have provided an excellent environment for the players to develop and grow as footballers.<br><br>Rob Lyon &amp; Steven Wilson<br>Manager’s AFC Varndeanians<br></p>
