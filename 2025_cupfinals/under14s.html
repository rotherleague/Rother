For some this may well be the first, and possibly the only, final they appear in during their football careers. I hope that the players enjoy the excitement of the occasion and look back afterwards with pride at their performance.&nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>It would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to thank our match officials and congratulate them on their appointment to today’s match. As a league, we are extremely grateful to all the referees who officiate at our matches throughout the season. Without them the League would not be able to run as it does. Sadly, there are often insufficient “black-shirts” to cover all the matches taking place each weekend., so if anyone here today would like to know a little more about becoming a qualified referee, please do read the article later in this program.&nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>&nbsp;Rother League has signed up to the Football Association’s “RESPECT” campaign.

I trust everyone here today will be appropriately ‘respectful’.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br></strong></div><div><strong>So, please enjoy the match and encourage all players. Cheer the winners, applaud the runners-ups,&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong>Finally, a big thankyou to our league sponsors Forestheath Engineering LTD&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong>Have a safe journey home.&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Zak Overfield</strong></div><div><strong>Chairman</strong></div><div><strong>Rother Youth Football League</strong></div></h3>

A team can afford to slip up once or twice over the course of the season when playing for its league place, but you obviously don’t have that luxury in a knockout tournament competition format.  However, the Rother League prides itself on being regarded as a sporting League, where the F in Football stands for FUN!  Today, although there are trophies at stake, I trust that this philosophy will continue to be maintained by everyone here.</div><div><br></div><div>These occasions should never pass without a huge vote of thanks to those who have made this Cup Final possible. I’d like to say a big ‘thank you’ to the Match Referee and Assistants, who turn up, week in and week out, often suffering torrents of rain (and even, sadly, occasional abuse). They are the unsung heroes of youth football, and I trust you will all show your gratitude to them at the end of the match and your respect for them during the game.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks also go to the various Committee members who run the League and give up large chunks of their personal time (without pay!) to ensure there is a local Youth League to take part in every weekend and Cups to compete for.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, my thanks go to you, the players, parents, supporters, managers and other Club Officials who make all this possible.

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">Westfield Youth U14</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>1. Vinnie Bourne<br></strong>This has been Vin’s 1st season with us and we couldn’t be happier with him. He is playing up a year but you would never guess. He is a great shot stopper, good hands and his distribution has got better and better. A very good goalkeeper with a bright future.<br><br><strong>2. Edward Muchabaiwa <br></strong>We have had Ed with us since u7’s and he has developed into a great young man. He is an all action defender who can play anywhere along the back line ( even though he tells me he is a winger every week ). Plays wherever we ask and never complains.<br><br><strong>3. Alfie Mann<br></strong>You will always hear Alf before you see him. Extremely loud on the pitch with lots of encouragement. A ball playing Left back who delivers the ball as good as anyone I have seen. Wins his battles well and is very productive with the football.<br><br><strong>4. Danny Cattermole ©<br></strong>Another player who has been here from the start. Danny always leads by example as you would expect your captain to do. Everything he does is for the team. A CM who loves a tackle and wants to get on the ball and get play moving. A very popular character within the group<br><br><strong>5. Taylor Sands<br></strong>New to us this season Taylor has fitted in well. Never gives us any problems and has a great attitude. Taylor is a CM but seems to be everywhere and wins as many tackles as anyone on the pitch. Does a lot of the dirty work in midfield and does it well.<br><br><strong>7. Alfie Saxby<br></strong>Alf is a big character within this team and on his day is an absolute game changer. Plays in midfield or the wing and displays a good football intelligence. He is always demanding more of himself. When he is on the ball he is always looking to get us on the attack and has popped up with a few goals too.<br><br><strong>8. Olly Butcher<br></strong>A strong defender who we can ask to play anywhere and he will do his best in that position. Had a bit of time off due to injury but has come back well in the last few weeks. He wins his headers and is always looking to pass the ball out to get the attack going.<br><br><strong>9. Max Cocks<br></strong>Max is the clubs vice captain and is massively versatile. He is one of the best CAM’s we have but is the 1st person we call on when we need to sure up the defence. He reads the game really well supports the attackers and midfielders with his work rate and has that bit of class to make things happen.<br><br><strong>10. Cody Payne-Foster<br></strong>Another day 1 at the club Cody is an attacking player with very good feet. Most of the time Cody plays on the wing and works hard for us. When he is on the ball he is always looking where the strickers are to get us on the attack. Lots of opposition are surprised by Cody’s strength off the ball.<br><br><strong>11. Rylan Powell<br></strong>Rylan is probably the most popular character in the team. Nicknamed “The Beast” he works his socks off. He will out pace most players and his strength is ridiculous. The beast is an attacker that can do a job in defence too. Rylans development this season has been great to be part of and his finishing has been fantastic.<br><br><strong>12. William Cornish<br></strong>Will isn’t one of the biggest but he will work hard on the pitch for us. Will normally play as a more attacking player as he definitely enjoys getting forward more than defending. Often coming off the bench this season Will has had a great attitude and he has scored his 1st Westfield goal too. <br><br><strong>15. Kai Kennard-Bowen<br></strong>Kai is one of our newest players but is one of the 1st names on the team sheet. The amount of tackles Kai wins is ridiculous and he times a slide tackle well. Wins his headers and is a real threat from corners too. He has been a great addition to the team. <br><br><strong>16. Harley Funnell <br></strong>Harley is one of the best at what he does. A CDM who loves a tackle and a battle in the midfield. Harley doesn’t get the credit he deserves sometimes as he does it week in week out. Very good on the ball and has the ability to to drive the whole team on with his performances. Another massive character and a natural leader.<br><br><strong>17. Dyari Imail ( Yaddie )<br></strong>Another new member to the squad. Yads must be absolutely horrible to play against. He seems to always win the ball but can’t be tackled. His energy levels are crazy and is always where the action is. His quick feet will make players dizzy. Yads is an absolute pleasure to manage and we all love watching him play.<br><br><strong>18. Alfie Jones<br></strong>What a find AJ has been. A goalkeeper who wanted to play up front. We took a chance on him this season and it’s been one of our best decisions. A real leader normally playing up top on his own. He is strong, fast and does not stop running. Even though he has well over 20 goals that’s not all his game is. We have lost count of the amount of assists he has got through hard work.<br><br><strong>19. Louie Bourne<br></strong>Louie was our goalkeeper last season but asked to play on field this year. He has done really well developing as an outfield player. He has loads of energy and works really hard for the team. He has good amount of goals too. A great player to have in the squad and will play wherever he is asked.<br><br><strong>20. Issac Collinson<br></strong>Yet another new addition. Not as loud as some of the other boys but a very good player who will keep developing because of his great attitude. Plays on the wing normally for us. Has a great 1st touch and is very cleaver on the ball. Has done well with some fantastic goals this season and is another with a good amount of assists.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">“It has been another great season for this group of young men. We have welcomed a number of new players this season and they have fitted in fantastically. That’s a real credit to all the boys.<br><br>It has been a real pleasure watching them all develop week in week out in both training sessions and matches and watching a group of leaders emerge. The boys have all worked extremely hard all season playing out of position some weeks when the team has needed it and listening to new tactics and embracing the changes.<br><br>We would like to thank all the parents for their continued support this season without you all there is no team. Special thanks to Ollie Jones &amp; Lee Mann who run the line for us most weeks and a massive thank you to Gav Bourne of GB Carpentry for sponsoring the kits this season."<br><br><br>Kevin Cattermole<br><strong>Manager, Westfield Youth U14’s</strong><br></p>
